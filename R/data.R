#' Functional Traits of Frugivorous Birds along a Tropical Gradient
#'
#' A dataset containing some functional traits of frugivorous birds in the Man√∫
#' biosphere reserve, southeast Peru. Given are species mean trait values.
#' The row names of the dataset give species names. Morphological
#' traits have been measured on museum specimen following Eck et al.(2011).
#' Traits have been measured only for adult and, if possible, for a minimum of
#' two female and two male specimens. Body mass was taken
#' from Dunning et al. (2007).

#' Functional Traits of Fleshy-fruit plants along a Tropical Gradient
#'
#' Taxonomy and functional traits of 392 fleshy-fruited plant species from
#' the Manu National Park in south-east Peru. Given are fruit length and
#' width (mm), plant height (m) and crop mass (g). Fruit traits have been
#' measured on fresh fruit samples. Number of fruits per plant
#' (used to determine the crop mass) and plant height have been estimated
#' in the field. Given are species mean trait values, except for 23 species
#' for which no species-level data was available and genus mean trait values
#' are given (see column "Genus mean"). Species names are indicated as
#' row names.  Plant.height..m. Crop.mass..g.
