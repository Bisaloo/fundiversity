`fundiversity` provides a lightweight package to compute common
functional diversity indices. The package is built using clear, public
[design
principles](https://github.com/Bisaloo/fundiversity/wiki/Design-principles)
inspired from our own experience and user feedback. We also strive to
use the latest good practice in software and R package development,
including minimal dependencies on external packages (currently
`fundiversity` only depends on `geometry`).

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Bisaloo/fundiversity")
```

## Example

`fundiversity` lets you compute three classical functional diversity
indices: Functional Richness with `fd_fric()`, Functional Divergence
with `fd_fdiv()`, and Rao’s Quadratic Entropy with \`fd\_raoq(). All
indices can be computed either using global trait data or at the
site-level:

``` r
library(fundiversity)

# Get trait data included in the package
data("traits_birds")

# Compute Functional Richness of all birds included
fd_fric(traits_birds)
#>   site     FRic
#> 1   s1 230967.7

# Compute Functional Divergence
fd_fdiv(traits_birds)
#>   site      FDiv
#> 1   s1 0.6011971

# Compute Rao's Quadratic Entropy
fd_raoq(traits_birds)
#>   site        Q
#> 1   s1 170.0519
```

To compute Rao’s Quadratic Entropy, the user can also provide a distance
matrix between species directly:

``` r
dist_traits_birds = as.matrix(dist(traits_birds))

fd_raoq(traits = NULL, dist_matrix = dist_traits_birds)
#>   site        Q
#> 1   s1 170.0519
```

## Related Packages

Several other packages exist that compute functional diversity indices,
we here mention some of them (but do not mention the wrappers around
these packages):
