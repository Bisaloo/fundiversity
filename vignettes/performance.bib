  abstract = {A unified framework to calculate biodiversity of ecological communities through Hill numbers (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006) was recently proposed by Chao, Chiu, \& Jost (2014). This framework can be applied to three facets of biodiversity: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. These three facets of biodiversity can be expressed as Hill numbers with the same units (effective number of species), facilitating direct comparisons between them (Chao et al., 2014). In addition, this framework can account for species abundance by changing the parameter q, which can be any non-negative number (e.g., 0, 0.99, 2). As q increases, the diversity values become more sensitive to common species. When q = 0, species abundance is ignored; q = 1, all species are weighted by their abundance equally (i.e., Shannonâ€™s diversity for taxonomic diversity); q = 2, common species get more weight than rare species (i.e., inverse of Simpson diversity for taxonomic diversity). Furthermore, both alpha and beta diversity can be calculated with this framework. Given the above advantages, this framework has been adopted by an increasing number of researchers.},

  abstract = {R is an open-source programming environment for statistical computing and graphics structured by numerous contributed packages. The current packages used for biodiversity research focus on limited, particular aspects of biodiversity. Most packages focus on the number and abundance of species. I present an r package named adiv that provides additional methods to measure and analyse biodiversity. adiv contains approaches to quantify species-based, trait-based (functional) and phylogenetic diversity (a) within communities (Î± diversity), (b) between communities (Î² diversity) and (c) to partition it over space and time (Î±, Î² and Î³ levels of diversity). Partitioning approaches allow evaluating whether the levels of Î± and Î² diversity could have been obtained by chance. Moreover, groups of biological entities (e.g. species of the same clade or with similar biological characteristics) that drive each level of diversity (Î±, Î² and Î³) can be identified via ordination analyses. Although the package focuses on interspecific diversity in its current state, the developed approaches can also be applied to analyse intraspecific diversity or, at another level, ecosystem diversity. More generally, the functions can be applied in any discipline interested in the concept of diversity, such as economics or linguistics. Indeed, all available approaches can be easily applied at other scales and to other disciplines provided that the data have the required format: a matrix of abundance or presence/absence data of some entities in some collections and information on the differences between the entities. adiv aims to complement existing r packages to provide scientists with a wide variety of diversity indices, as each index reflects a very specific facet of biodiversity. adiv will grow in the future to integrate as many validated approaches for biodiversity analysis as possible, not yet available in r. As it includes both traditional and recent viewpoints on how biodiversity should be evaluated, adiv offers a promising platform where methods to analyse biodiversity can be developed and compared in terms of their statistical behaviour and biological relevance. Applications of the most relevant tools for a given study aim will eventually improve research on human-driven variations in biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Hill numbers or the effective number of species are increasingly used to quantify species diversity of an assemblage. Hill numbers were recently extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences among species traits. We review these extensions and integrate them into a framework of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species), phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, SÃ¸rensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. A real example shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.},
